      <p>
        I began my work in the food industry during the summer of 2018 doing retail audits for Rosati’s Ice out of Clifton Heights PA. After learning the ropes from the team at Rosati’s, I launched my own retail auditing service the following year. COVID-19 took a toll on my business, but in that I am alike many in this time. In the advent of the new age we find ourselves in, I am focused in my objective of providing an effective and efficient service for those I work with professionally.
